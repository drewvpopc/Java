A. Type= byte, 4, Hopefully you dont have over 127 siblings
B. Type= Char, C, Just trying to be realistic ;)
C. Type= Long, 7,700,000,000, This number is above the max for a int soo you would have to use a long
D. Type= Int, 327,200,000, This number doesnt cross the max for an int so it would be the best used
E. Type= byte, 16, I would hope you don't have 127 people on a bus
F. Type= Short, 1320, this is the max for a scabble score, goes above the required amount for a byte
G. Type= Byte, 5, Typically MLB games dont go above 127
H. Type= Short, 1492, Most events happened after the year 127
i. Type= Byte, 4, Clear answer here
J. Type= Short, 24,000, i mean you could also use a long, but please dont burn money
